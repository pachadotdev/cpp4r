<p><em>For an extended review of the topics discussed in this vignette,
please refer to the pre-print <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5583590">cpp4r:
A Header-Only C++ and R Interface</a>.</em></p>
<p>cpp4r is an R package that provides C++11 bindings to R, enabling the
use of C++ code in R packages. It is a fork of the cpp11 package <span class="citation">(Vaughan, Hester, and François 2025)</span> aiming to
provide additional features and improvements while maintaining
compatibility with the original cpp11 API.</p>
<p>The R programming language is an open-source version of the S
programming language dating back to the 1970s, and even today its
internals use C and FORTRAN routines for some tasks <span class="citation">(Chambers 2006)</span>. This design decision is not
arbitrary: C and FORTRAN, while not particularly easy to use, are highly
efficient for computationally intensive tasks. Even after optimizing R
code through vectorization and avoiding unnecessary object copying,
bottlenecks may persist and require compiled language solutions.</p>
<p>For certain applications, such as fitting regression models with a
large number of fixed effects <span class="citation">(Yotov et al.
2017)</span>, computational efficiency can be an issue for any
interpreted language, not just R which is in the interpreted languages
family. Other examples of interpreted languages are Python, JavaScript
and proprietary languages such as MATLAB, Maple, and Wolfram.</p>
<p>C++ is a compiled language (as C and FORTRAN) that offers particular
advantages for addressing common R performance bottlenecks,
including:</p>
<ul><li>Loops that cannot be easily vectorized due to dependencies between
iterations</li>
<li>Recursive functions or problems requiring many function calls</li>
<li>Data structures and algorithms not natively available in R (e.g., R
does not let the end-user use pointers and pass-by-reference
semantics)</li>
<li>Problems requiring fine-tuning memory management</li>
</ul><p>C++, like any compiled language, offers additional computational
efficiency, but it involves setup effort that can be considerable in
terms of time and configuring the required software stack to compile
code and create an executable. R, like other interpreted languages, does
not require creating executable files; it can execute instructions line
by line, offering greater portability and the ability to introduce small
changes to the code without the need to recompile.</p>
<p>Compiled languages do not reduce time complexity, and a direct
rewrite of R code in C++ can reduce runtime because C++ typically
executes each operation faster. In practical terms, a double loop in R
can be as inefficient as a double for loop in C++, with the difference
that C++ typically takes less time per operation. For some problems it
is possible to derive reduced forms or new algorithms that require a
different set of instructions to obtain the same result; an example of
this is <span class="citation">Vargas Sepulveda (2025)</span>, which
discusses an alternative formulation to compute Kendall’s correlation
coefficient with time complexity <span class="math inline">\(O(n
\log(n))\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(O(n^2)\)</span>
using the traditional algorithm.</p>
<p>Additionally, C++ offers more flexible data structures and allows the
direct creation of operator overloads and friend functions that provide
flexibility to work with a wide range of data formats <span class="citation">(Emara 2024)</span>, even ‘esoteric’ binary formats
lacking documentation <span class="citation">(Sepúlveda and Barkai
2025)</span>. While it is possible to write R functions using C, for
simplicity it is often more convenient to use C++, as it is a superset
of C and supports object-oriented programming rather than purely
functional programming <span class="citation">(Emara 2024)</span>. This
facilitates working with matrices, complex numbers, and other data
structures such as cubes and fields <span class="citation">(Sanderson
and Curtin 2016)</span>. Choosing C++ over FORTRAN is also often a
matter of simplicity.</p>
<p>C++ bindings for R date back to the early 2000s. The cxx package
<span class="citation">(Hornik 2001)</span>, released in 2000 and now
discontinued, provided an early prototype of C++ bindings. Rcpp <span class="citation">(Eddelbuettel and Francois 2011)</span>, first
published to CRAN in 2008, is the mainstream solution and used by over
3,000 packages as of 2025.</p>
<p>cpp11 <span class="citation">(Vaughan, Hester, and François
2025)</span> was released in 2023 as a complete reimplementation of C++
bindings to R, with different design trade-offs compared to Rcpp aiming
to provide:</p>
<ul><li>Enforced copy-on-write semantics consistent with R’s behavior</li>
<li>Improved safety when interfacing with R’s C API</li>
<li>Native support for ALTREP objects</li>
<li>UTF-8 string handling throughout</li>
<li>Modern C++11 features and idioms</li>
<li>Simplified implementation compared to Rcpp</li>
<li>Faster compilation with reduced memory requirements</li>
<li>Completely header-only design to avoid Application Binary Interface
(ABI) compatibility issues</li>
</ul><p>However, cpp11 lacks some Rcpp features that explain its widespread
adoption, including:</p>
<ul><li>Syntactic sugar (e.g., helper functions that allow for a more
concise or convenient way to express common patterns)</li>
<li>Modules (e.g., helpers to export C++ functions and/or classes to R
more easily)</li>
<li>Attributes (e.g., decorators to expose C++ functions to R with
minimal boilerplate code)</li>
</ul><p>While using cpp11 for my thesis project, I identified several
enhancements that could benefit the R community and improve the
library’s usability. These enhancements include:</p>
<ul><li>Support for converting C++ maps to R lists</li>
<li>Roxygen documentation support directly in C++ code</li>
<li>Proper handling of matrix attributes</li>
<li>Support for nullable external pointers</li>
<li>Immediate availability of values added via
<code>push_back()</code></li>
<li>Bidirectional copy of complex number types</li>
<li>Flexibility in type conversions</li>
<li>Various performance optimizations</li>
<li>Specialized codebase to benefit from newer C++ standards (e.g., if
C++20 is available, compiling a package will use C++20 features instead
of being limited to C++11)</li>
</ul><p>After discussing these proposed enhancements with the cpp11
maintainers, it became clear that the development priorities and
timelines would not accommodate these features in the near term. This
led to the creation of cpp4r, a fork of cpp11 that incorporates these
additional features while maintaining compatibility with the original
cpp11 API. This means that cpp4r can serve as a drop-in replacement for
cpp11 in any case, allowing users to benefit from the enhancements
without significant code changes. The converse, replacing cpp4r with
cpp11, requires adjustments due to the additional features in cpp4r.</p>
<p>cpp4r extends cpp11’s container support by enabling seamless
conversion between C++ standard library containers and R objects. This
includes support for <code>std::map</code> and
<code>std::unordered_map</code> containers, which are automatically
converted to named R lists.</p>
<p>cpp4r provides roxygen support directly in C++ code, allowing
developers to document their C++ functions using familiar roxygen2
syntax. This integration streamlines the documentation workflow for
packages that expose C++ functions to R.</p>
<p>Unlike cpp11, cpp4r properly handles matrix attributes, including
<code>dimnames</code>, ensuring that matrix operations preserve metadata
when copying data between R and C++.</p>
<p>cpp4r offers more flexible type conversion functions. For example,
<code>as_integers()</code> and <code>as_doubles()</code> accept logical
inputs, providing greater flexibility in handling diverse input types
compared to the more restrictive cpp11 implementations.</p>
<p>Several internal optimizations improve performance over cpp11,
particularly in vector operations and memory management. These
optimizations maintain the safety guarantees of cpp11 while improving
execution speed.</p>
<p>cpp4r provides full bidirectional copying of complex numbers,
enabling seamless transfer of complex vectors and matrices between R and
C++ code. In contrast, cpp11 does not support this functionality.</p>
<p>cpp4r maintains cpp11’s core design principles while extending
functionality:</p>
<ul><li>Copy-on-Write Semantics: Like cpp11, cpp4r enforces copy-on-write
semantics that match R’s behavior, preventing unexpected modifications
to input data.</li>
<li>Safety First: cpp4r incorporates comprehensive safety mechanisms
when interfacing with R’s C API, using <code>unwind_protect()</code> and
exception handling to prevent resource leaks.</li>
<li>Modern C++ Features: The implementation leverages C++11 features
including move semantics, type traits, variadic templates, and
user-defined literals.</li>
<li>Header-Only Design: As a completely header-only library, cpp4r
avoids ABI compatibility issues that can arise with libraries containing
compiled components.</li>
</ul><p>cpp4r offers vendoring capabilities, which means copying the
dependency code directly into your project’s source tree. This approach,
borrowed from the Go programming language, includes the dependencies’
headers with the source code <span class="citation">(The Go Authors
2024)</span>. This ensures the dependency code remains fixed and stable
until explicitly updated. Since cpp4r is a header-only library, you can
copy all headers by running <code>cpp4r::vendor_cpp4r()</code> when
needed.</p>
<p>Vendoring has both advantages and drawbacks. The main advantage is
that disruptive changes to the cpp4r project cannot break your existing
code. The drawbacks include slightly larger package size and isolation
from bugfixes and new features until you explicitly update the vendored
headers. Most packages should not vendor the cpp4r dependency, except
for projects designed to run in restricted environments where internet
access is limited or unavailable for security reasons (e.g.,
high-performance computing clusters).</p>
<p>cpp4r is designed as a drop-in replacement for cpp11, using identical
syntax and API patterns. Existing cpp11 code can typically be migrated
to cpp4r with minimal changes, primarily involving header includes and
namespace references.</p>
