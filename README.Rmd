cpp4r helps you to interact with R objects using C++ code.
It is a fork of the [cpp11](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cpp11) package with identical syntax and similar goals.

⚠️Important⚠️: cpp4r was created to ease writing functions in your own packages and does not offer on-the-fly
compilation for code snippets.

cpp4r can be used as a replacement for cpp11 in existing or new packages. Think of cpp11 and cpp4r as MySQL and MariaDB:
they are almost identical, but cpp4r has some extra features.

cpp4r requires at least C++11. It is compatible with C++14, C++17, C++20, C++23 as well. The headers are written in
a way that is compatible with all of these standards and newer features are used if the compiler supports them.

After discussing some [pull requests](https://github.com/pachadotdev/cpp11/pulls/pachadotdev) with Hadley Wickham from
Posit, it was mentioned that I should create my own fork to add the following features:

- [x] Convert ordered and unordered C++ maps to R lists.
- [x] Roxygen support on C++ side.
- [x] Allow `dimnames` attribute with matrices on C++ side.
- [x] Support nullable `external_ptr<>`.
- [x] Use values added to a vector with `push_back()` immediately.
- [x] Support bidirectional passing of complex numbers/vectors.
- [x] Provide flexibility with data types (e.g., cpp4r's `as_integers()` and `as_doubles()` accept logical inputs while
  cpp11's do not).
- [x] Some internal optimizations for better speed (e.g., https://github.com/r-lib/cpp11/pull/463 and
  https://github.com/r-lib/cpp11/pull/430).

## Getting started

Check the [documentation](https://cpp4r.org/) to get started using cpp4r in your scripts, particularly if you are new to
C++ programming.

You can install cpp4r from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("cpp4r", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")
```

Or the development version from GitHub:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("pachadotdev/cpp4r")
```

## Using cpp4r in a package

Create a new package with `cpp4r::pkg_template("~/path/to/mypkg")` and then edit the generated files.

To add cpp4r to an existing package, put your C++ files in the `src/` directory and add the following to your
DESCRIPTION file:

```
LinkingTo: cpp4r
```

Then add a roxygen header, for example, to `R/mypkg-package.R`:

```r
#' @useDynLib mypkg, .registration = TRUE
#' @keywords internal
"_PACKAGE"
```

Then decorate C++ functions you want to expose to R with `[[cpp4r::register]]`.

cpp4r is a header only library with no hard dependencies and does not use a shared library. It is straightforward and
reliable to use in packages without fear of compile-time and run-time mismatches.

## Vendoring

You can [vendor](https://cpp4r.org/articles/01-motivations.html) the current installed version of cpp4r headers into
your package with `cpp4r::vendor()`.

The [cpp4rvendor](https://github.com/pachadotdev/cpp4r/tree/main/cpp4rtest) package shows an example of vendoring cpp4r
headers.

Vendoring ensures the headers will remain unchanged until you explicitly update them. The advantage is that your package
will not break if there are breaking changes in future versions of cpp4r. The disadvantage is that you will not get bug
fixes and new features unless you update the vendored headers.
