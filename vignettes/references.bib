	abstract = {Benchmarking is a widely used method in experimental computer science, in particular, for the comparative evaluation of tools and algorithms. As a consequence, a number of questions need to be answered in order to ensure proper benchmarking, resource measurement, and presentation of results, all of which is essential for researchers, tool developers, and users, as well as for tool competitions. We identify a set of requirements that are indispensable for reliable benchmarking and resource measurement of time and memory usage of automatic solvers, verifiers, and similar tools, and discuss limitations of existing methods and benchmarking tools. Fulfilling these requirements in a benchmarking framework can (on Linux systems) currently only be done by using the cgroup and namespace features of the kernel. We developed BenchExec, a ready-to-use, tool-independent, and open-source implementation of a benchmarking framework that fulfills all presented requirements, making reliable benchmarking and resource measurement easy. Our framework is able to work with a wide range of different tools, has proven its reliability and usefulness in the International Competition on Software Verification, and is used by several research groups worldwide to ensure reliable benchmarking. Finally, we present guidelines on how to present measurement results in a scientifically valid and comprehensible way.},

'Econometrics' provides graduate and PhD students with an essential introduction to this foundational subject in economics and serves as an invaluable reference for researchers and practitioners. This comprehensive textbook teaches fundamental concepts, emphasizes modern, real-world applications, and gives students an intuitive understanding of econometrics. Covers the full breadth of econometric theory and methods with mathematical rigor while emphasizing intuitive explanations that are accessible to students of all backgrounds ; draws on integrated, research-level datasets, provided on an accompanying website ; discusses linear econometrics, time series, panel data, nonparametric methods, nonlinear econometric models, and modern machine learning ; features hundreds of exercises that enable students to learn by doing ; includes in-depth appendices on matrix algebra and useful inequalities and a wealth of real-world examples ; can serve as a core textbook for a first-year PhD course in econometrics and as a follow-up to Bruce E. Hansen's 'Probability and Statistics for Economists'.--taken from back cover., "This textbook is the second in a two-part series covering the core material typically taught in a one-year Ph.D. course in econometrics. The sequence is : 1. 'Probability and Statistics for Economists' (first volume) ; 2. 'Econometrics' (this volume). 'Econometrics' assumes that students have a background in multivariate calculus, probability theory, linear algebra, and mathematical statistics. A prior course in undergraduate econometrics would be helpful but is not required. The relevant background in probability theory and mathematical statistics is provided in 'Probability and Statistics for Economists'. For reference, the basic tools of matrix algebra and probability inequalites are reviewed in Appendixes A and B. This textbook contains more material than can be covered in a one-semester course. This is intended to provide instructors flexibility concerning which topics to cover, which to cover in depth, and which to cover briefly. Some material is suitable for second-year Ph.D. instruction."--adapted from Preface, page xxv.},

However, significant limitations persist, including its proprietary nature, lack of documentation, and restricted flexibility for advanced data analysis. These challenges hinder the transformation of raw census data into actionable information for policymakers, researchers, and advocacy groups. To address these issues, we developed Open REDATAM, an open-source and multiplatform tool that converts REDATAM data into widely supported CSV files and native R and Python data structures. By providing integration with R and Python, Open REDATAM empowers users to work with the tools they already know and perform data analyses without leaving their R or Python window. Our work emphasizes the need for a REDATAM official format specification to further enable informed policy debates that can improve policy processes’ implementation and feedback.},
