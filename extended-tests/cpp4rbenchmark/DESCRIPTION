Title: Checking speed improvement/worsening with different C++ standards for cpp4r
Description: Benchmark adapted from the official Armadillo documentation to test the speed of different C++ standards
    when using the cpp4r package. The idea is to check how compiling with GCC or Clang using C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20
    or C++23 affects the speed of various linear algebra operations.
